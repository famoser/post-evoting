# Control Components
The control components generate the return codes, shuffle the encrypted votes, and decrypt them at the end of the election. We assume that there are four control components and at least one (per type) is trustworthy. There are two types of control components:

| Name     | Description    | 
| --------|---------|
| **Return Codes Control Component**  | Compute the Choice Return Codes and the Vote Cast Return Codeâ€”in interaction with the setup component (configuration phase) and the voting server (voting phase).    |
| **Mixing Control Component** | Mix and partially decrypt ciphertexts in the ballot box.  |

## Usage
The control components are packaged as standalone SpringBoot applications.

## Development

```
mvn clean install
```
